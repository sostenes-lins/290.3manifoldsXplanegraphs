\begin{abstract}
A {\em blink} is a plane graph with an arbitrary bipartition of its edges.
As a consequence of a recent result of Martelli, I show that the homeomorphisms classes
of closed oriented 3-manifolds are in 1-1 correspondence with specific classes of blinks. 
In these classes, two blinks are equivalent if they are linked by a finite sequence of 
local moves, where each one
appears in a concrete list of 64 moves: they organize in 8 types,
each beeing essentlially the same move on 8 simply related configurations. 
The size of the list can be substantially
decreased at the cost of loosing symmetry, just by keeping a very simple move type,
the {\em ribbon moves} denoted $\pm \mu_{11}^{\pm}$ (which are in principle redundant). 
The inclusion of $\pm \mu_{11}^{\pm}$  implies that
all the moves corresponding to plane duality (the starred moves), except for $\mu_{20}^\star$
and $\mu_{02}^\star$, are redundant and the coin calculus is reduced to 36 moves on 36 coins.
It is in the aegis of this work to find new important connections 
between 3-manifolds and plane graphs.

\section{Introduction}

A {\em blink} is a plane graph with an arbitrary edge bipartition into
two colors (black and gray). {\em Plane} means that it is given embedded in a plane.
Two blinks $B$ and $B'$ are the same if there is an isotopy of the plane into itself so that 
the image of $B$ is $B'$. The next four blinks are all distinct even tough they have the same 
subjacent graph: 
\raisebox{-2mm}{\includegraphics[width=40mm]{A.figs/distinctblinkssamegraph.pdf}}.

\subsection{Statement of the Theorem}
This paper proves the following theorem:
\begin{theorem}
\label{theo:theorem}
 The classes homeomorphisms of closed oriented connected 3-manifolds are in 1-1 correspondence
 with the equivalence classes of blinks where two blinks are equivalent if they are
 linked by a finite sequence of the local moves where each term is 
 one of the 64 moves (not necessary distinct) below\\
 \begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=16cm]{A.figs/blinkcalculus.pdf} 
  \end{center}
  \end{theorem}

 There are 64 local configurations of sub-blinks, each named a {\em coin}, 
 divided into 8 families of 8 simply related
 coins and also divided into 32 pairs of left-right coins,
  A move replaces the left (right) coin of a pair by its right (left) 
 coin. Thus, the number of moves is equal to the number of coins.
 Boundary and internal vertices of the coins are shown as small white disks. 
  The complementary sub-blink in the exterior a coin is completely arbitrary; 
 its intersection with the corresponding internal coin is a subset of the set of 
 attachment vertices in the boundary of the coin.
 The support of the coins
 are disks, except in the the right coin  
 of $\mu_{20}$, case in which is a pinched disk. 
 The number $k$ of the attachment vertices  satisfies $k\in \{0,1,2,3,4\}$. 
 
 \subsection{Organization of the paper}
 In Section \ref{sec:motivationtopprelim} the motivation, the topological 
 preliminaries and an epistemological view of the work are discussed.
 The proof of the Theorem \ref{theo:theorem} 
 is given in Section \ref{sec:prooftheorem}.
 A reduced but sufficient form of this coin 
 calculus having 36 coins (and moves) is obtained in Section \ref{sec:roleribbonmoves}.
 In Section \ref{sec:conclusion} I display a census (no misses, no duplicates) of
 the closed, oriented, connected, prime 3-manifold induced by blinks up to 8 edges.

\section{Motivation and topological preliminaries}
\label{sec:motivationtopprelim}
\subsection{Motivation}

In his Appendix to part 0, J. H. Conway in his famous book {\em On Numbers and Games}, 
\cite{onnumbersandgames}, says: {\em ``This appendix is in fact a cry for a Mathematician
Liberation Movement!

Among the permissible kinds of constructions we should have:\\
(i) Objects may be created from earlier objects in any reasonable constructive fashion.\\
(ii) Equality among the created objects can be any desirable equivalence relation.''
} 
 
This paper is in the confluency of two deep research passions of the author, 
apparently very far apart:
the topological study of closed orientable 3-manifolds and the combinatorial study of plane 
graphs.  The result proved here provides a glimpse, in the spirit of 
Conway's quotation, to effectively
enumerate once each closed orientable 3-manifolds. 
Blinks are easy to construct from simpler blinks, and their 
isomorphism problem can be solved by a polynomial
algorithm which finds, via a few fixed conventions (lexicography), a numerical {\em code} for it. 
What can be more desirable than an equivalence relation on such simple mathematical 
objects that captures the subtle and difficult computational topological notion of
factorizing any homeomorphism between two closed, oriented, connected 3-manifolds?
 
\subsection{Topological preliminaries}

This subsection contains the basic topological material that I need. 
It is primarely intended to the 
combinatorially oriented readers, unfamiliar with the fundamental definitions of knots, 
links and framed lins.
The topological oriented readers also should read it 
because I introduce some unfamiliar notation and 
definitions which are new and that will be 
used throughout the paper. Moreover, I present a short historic 
overview of the known results needed.

\subsubsection{Knots and links into $\mathbb{R}^3$ and into $\mathbb{S}^3$}

A {\em knot $K$} is an embedding of a circle,  $\mathbb{S}^1$, into $\mathbb{R}^3$
(or $\mathbb{S}^3$, the boundary of a 4-dimensional ball).
The {\em unknot} is a knot which is the boundary of a disk.
A {\em link with $k$ components} is an embedding of a disjoint union of $k$ 
copies of $\mathbb{S}^1$,
$\left(\cup_{i=1}^k \mathbb{S}^1_i \right)$,
into $\mathbb{R}^3$ ((or $\mathbb{S}^3$) with disjoint images. 
In this way, a knot is a particular case of a link: one which
has one component. Fig. \ref{fig:R3S3} shows a 1-1 correspondence
$K \leftrightarrow K'$ between knots into $\mathbb{R}^3$ and into $\mathbb{S}^3$. 
By abuse of language, I feel free to identify a knot with its image.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{A.figs/R3S3.pdf} 
\caption{\sf How a knot $K$ into $\mathbb{R}^3$ 
is related to a knot $K'$ into $\mathbb{S}^3$: 
the 3-sphere $\mathbb{S}^3$
is the boundary of a 4-ball $\mathbb{B}^4$; the knot $K$ is contained 
in a ball $\mathbb{B}^ 3$ of radius $r$ centered in the origin $O$ and 
contained in the equator $\{(x,y,z,w) \in \mathbb{B}^4 \ | \ w=0\}$; by making 
$\frac{R}{r}$ big knots $K$ (which the south pole of the 4-ball)
and $K'$ are as close as being isometric as desired. $K'$ is the image of $K$ under the
stereographic projection $\zeta$ centered at the south pole $S$. In this work I need 
to work with knots into $\mathbb{R}^3$ and into $\mathbb{S}^3$. Thus the 
easy correspondence between the two types is welcome.
}

\end{figure} 


Links can be presented with profit by their {\em decorated 
general position projections} into the $xy$-plane $\mathbb{R}^2$,
by simply making 0 the $z$-coordinate. Recall that we have already make $w=0$.
Here {\em general position} means that 
in the image of the link there is no triple points and that at each neighborhood of
a double point is the transversal crossing of two segments of the link, named {\em strands}. 
{\em Decorated} means that we keep the information
of which strand is the upper one, usually by removing a piece of the lower strand. In this paper
I use yet another way to decorate the link projections: the images of the link components 
are thich black curves
and the upper strands are indicated by a thinner white segment inside the thich 
black curve at the crossing (see second definition in Fig. \ref{fig:somenotation}).

\subsubsection{Framed knots, ribbons, framed links and blackboard framed links into $\mathbb{R}^3$}
A {\em framed knot} is an embedding of  
$\mathbb{S}^1 \times [-\epsilon,+\epsilon]$  
into $\mathbb{R}^3$ (or $\mathbb{S}^3$), for an arbitrarily fixed $\epsilon>0$. 
A framed knot is also called {\em a ribbon}.
The {\em base knot} of a ribbon
is the ribbon restricted to $\mathbb{S}^1 \times\{0\}$. 
A {\em framed link} is a collection of ribbons with disjoint images. The ribbons 
that I use are prepared by isotopies so that their projections remain with constant
width $2\epsilon$. Fig. \ref{fig:GettingImmersedBandSameWidth} 
shows how to achieve this condition.
A collection of these constant width ribbons is called 
a {\em blackboard framed link}.


\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{A.figs/GettingImmersedBandSameWidth.pdf} 
\caption{\sf Getting a constant width immersion of a ribbon projection into $\mathbb{R}^2$. 
Each 360-degree rotation of the ribbon projection is ambient isotopic to
a curl in the ribbon (in two different ways) so as to maintain  
constant the width immersion of the ribbon projection.
In particular, after making these isotopies, the intersection of the images of
$\mathbb{S}^1 \times\{-\epsilon\}$
and $\mathbb{S}^1 \times\{+\epsilon\}$
have 4 distinct points (it used to have 2 points) 
near each crossing of the base link and there are no other 
crossings in the immersed ribbons. 
}
\label{fig:GettingImmersedBandSameWidth}
\end{center}
\end{figure} 

The isotopy class of a framed link is determined by assigning an 
integer to each component of the link which is equal to the {\em linking number} of the
two components of the boundary of each of its bands oriented in the same way. The linking number 
can be obtained from an arbitrary decorated general position projection of the oriented band:
it is half of the algebraic sum of the $(\pm)$-signs of the crossings of distinct boundary components.
The convention is that
\raisebox{-3mm}{\includegraphics[width=3cm]{A.figs/plusoneminusonecrossing.pdf}}
The linking number is an invariant, that is, it does not depend on 
the particular projection used. This is proved by K. Reidemeister in its 1932 book
on Knot Theory, \cite{reid1932}. He isolates three local moves $r_1, r_2, r_3$ that
are enough to finitely factor any arbitrary ambient isotopy between two decorated general 
position projections of the same link:
\raisebox{-3mm}{\includegraphics[width=7cm]{A.figs/reidemeistermoves.pdf}}.

As a matter of fact, Theorem \ref{theo:theorem} which 
I proved in this work is the counterpart for 3-manifolds
of Reidemeister Theorem. Note that in the coin calculus depicted together
with bflinks in Fig. \ref{fig:bflinkandlinktogether}
there are 8 versions of each of Reidemeister moves $r_2$ and $r_3$. Note also that 
Reidemeister move $r_1$ is not used at all. 
The equivalence class of decorated general position link projection generated
by $r_2^{\pm 1}$ and $r_3^{\pm 1}$ is called {\em regular isotopy}. It plays an important role
in the computation of the Jones invariants via Kauffman's bracket \cite{kauffman1987state}.



A {\em blackboard framed link} is a projection of a framed link prepared by isotopy so that 
the base link is projected as a decorated general position one and its bands are immersed
with constant width $2\epsilon$, see Fig. \ref{fig:GettingImmersedBandSameWidth}.  
Moreover, we adjust the number of curls and their signs 
(in the base link) so that the framing of each component coincides with the linking number of 
the two boundary components of the band. The advantage of the blackboard framed link is that
we no longer have to worry about assigning numbers to the components. These integer 
numbers are induced
by the plane of projection. The importance of this concept was 
advocated by L. Kauffman in a number of works, including \cite{kauffman1991knots} and 
\cite{kauffman1994tlr}. In this work, it is central: every framed link I use is 
blackboard framed. 

A {\em bflink} is the projection of the base link of a blackboard framed link. 
Thus a bflink is a 
decorated general position link projection, with no numbers attached. 
Fig. \ref{fig:linkblink} shows a 1-1 correspondence between bflinks and blinks.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{A.figs/linkblink.pdf} 
\caption{\sf From bflink to blink and back: 
the projection of any link can be 2-face colorable into white and gray with the infinite
face being white so that each subcurve between two crossing have their incident faces receiving distinct
colors. The above figure shows how to transform a link projection into a blink (with thicker edges
than the curves representing the link projection). 
The vertices of the blink are distinguished fixed
points represented by white disks in the interior of the gray faces. 
Each crossing of the link projection becomes an edge in the corresponding blink, 
An edge of the blink is gray if the upper strand 
that crosses it is from northwest to southeast, it is black if the the upper strand 
that crosses it is from northeast
to southwest. The inverse procedure
is clearly defined. In fact, the link is the so called {\em medial map} of the blink.
Thus we have a 1-1 correspondence between general position decorated link projections
and blinks. The (complete) blink at the right induces Poincaré's sphere, 
the spherical dodecahedron space. The expressibility of a blink is powerful: quite
complicated 3-manifolds are induced by simple blinks.}

\subsubsection{Lickorish's groundbreaking result and more link type objects}
In a grounding breaking work (1962),  W.B.R. Lickorish, 
\cite{lickorish1962representation}, proved that
any closed, oriented, connected $\mathbb{M}^3$ has inside it a finite number
$k$ of disjoint solid tori each in the form of a homeomorphic image 
of $\mathbb{S}^ 1  \times[-\epsilon,+\epsilon]\times[-\delta,+\delta]$,
denoted by  $(\mathbb{S}^ 1  \times[-\epsilon,+\epsilon]\times[-\delta,+\delta])_i$
so that, where $\mathbb{S}^ 3$ is the 3-dimensional sphere, 
$$\mathbb{M}^ 3\backslash \bigcup_{i=1}^k 
(\mathbb{S}^ 1  \times[-\epsilon,+\epsilon]\times[-\delta,+\delta])_i=
\mathbb{S}^ 3\backslash \bigcup_{i=1}^k (\mathbb{S}^1 
\times[-\epsilon,+\epsilon]\times[-\delta,+\delta])_i.$$
As a consequence, each closed oriented 3-manifold can be obtained from $\mathbb{S}^3$ 
by removing a subset of disjoint solid tori and pasting them back in a different way.
The most general parameters to identify the pasting is a pair of integers for each 
component of the link. A filling algorithm algorithm applies component by component, is named 
{\em $(\pm p,q)$-Dehn filling}, and is explained in Fig. \ref{fig:General_pq_DehnFilling}. 
For proving the theorem, and this is important in the present work, the fillings used 
by Lickorish satisfy $q=1$. He call these surgeries {\em honest}.
Actually, Lickorish's result had been proved 2 years before 
by A. H. Wallace \cite{wallace1960modifications} by using differential geometry. However
it was the purely topological flavor of Lickorish's proof that spurred
the subsequent developments. Also, Lickorish does not state his theorem in this way.
The form I use for the solid tori is convenient because of its simple relation with bflinks.
It is inspired in the lucid account by J. Stillwell of the theorem 
given in \cite{stillwell1993classical}.



\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=13.0cm]{A.figs/General_pq_DehnFilling.pdf} 
\caption{\sf Dehn's $(\pm p,q)$-filling of a toroidal hole $T$ and its particular case
where $q=1$, yielding a well defined bflink (or link) as input for an algorithm to produce
a 3-manifold:
suppose that $\frac{\pm p}{q}$ is an irreducible fraction, where the case 
$q$=0, $p=1$ is permitted. 
Consider a solid torus in $\mathbb{S}^3$ as the homeomorphic image of 
$\mathbb{S}^ 1  \times[-\epsilon,+\epsilon]\times[-\delta,+\delta]$, denoted by $T$,
where $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ are arbitrarily small fixed positive constants. $T$ can be
changed by ambient isotopy so that for each $s \in \mathbb{S}^1$,
$T$ restricted to $\{s\} \times [-\epsilon,+\epsilon] \times [-\delta,+\delta]$,
is a rectangle which is orthogonal to the projection $xy$-plane. Therefore,
the projection of its restriction to 
$\mathbb{S}^ 1  \times[-\epsilon,+\epsilon]\times \{\delta\}$ is a blackboard framed
link whose base link $\lambda$ is defined by the restriction of $T$ to  
$\mathbb{S}^ 1  \times\{0\} \times \{\delta\}.$ 
The important fact is that $\lambda$ does not touch the boundary of its immersed band
forming the projection of the blackboard framed link. Let $\theta$ be
a curve that bounds a disk in $T$ but not in its boundary, $\partial(T)$.
The curve $\pm p.\theta + q.\lambda$ is isotopic to a simple curve in $\partial(T)$.
Map this curve homeomorphically to $m$, a curve in a canonical solid torus $T'$
in $\mathbb{R}^3$ so that it bounds a disk in $T'$ but not in $\partial(T')$.
This homeomorphism is univocally extensible to identify $\partial(T)$ and $\partial(T')$
thus closing the toroidal hole. Note that the whole situation is defined
by the knot $K \equiv \mathbb{S}^ 1  \times \{0\} \times \{0\}$ and the surgery coeficients
$(\pm p,q)$. In his original paper Lickorish only use Dehn fillings of type $(\pm p,1)$,
corresponding to what he calls {\em honesty surgeries}. For such surgeries each component $K$ 
may be curl-adjusted so as the whole link becomes a bflink where each $\pm p$ is given by the 
linking number of the boundary components of the corresponding band. 
This establishes an algorithm to obtain a 
well defined closed, oriented, connected 3-manifold $\mathbb{M}^3$ 
from a bflink, or from a blink, as input. By Lickorish's theorem, every such manifold arises
in this way. Even if the blink is not connected, $\mathbb{M}^3$  is connected: in general,
it is the connected sum of the manifolds induced by the connected components of the blink
which induces it.

An {\em hflink} is the base link of a framed link $L_1 \cup \ldots \cup L_k$ endowed with
the surgery coefficients $(\pm p_1,q_1), \ldots (\pm p_k,q_k)$. 
A {\em residual bflink} of an hflink,
or an {\em r-bflink}, is obtained by effecting an ambient isotopy in an hflink so that
in the projected base link of the hflink all the surgery coefficients 
satisfy $$\frac{\pm p_i}{q_i}=z_i+\frac{p'_i}{q_i},$$
where $z_i$ is an integer equal to the linking number of boundary components of
the $i$-th band of the hflink and $0<p_i<q_i$. Of course this can be achieved only
by inserting adequate curls.

\subsubsection{Kirby's famous calculus of framed links}
In 1978 R. Kirby published his, to become famous, calculus of framed links, \cite{kirby1978calculus}.
The gist of this paper is that two types of moves 
are enough to go from any framed
link inducing a closed oriented 3-manifold to any other such link inducing the same manifold.
One of the moves is absolutelly local: creating or cancellating an arbitrary new unknotted 
component with frame $\pm 1$ separated from the rest of the link by an $\mathbb{S}²$.
The other type of move, {\em the band move}, \cite{kirby1978calculus, 
kauffman1991knots}) {\em (or handle sliding)} is non-local and infinite in number.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{A.figs/handleslide.pdf} 
\caption{\sf Kirby's {\em handle slide move}, also known as the {\em band move}. 
In this work the handle slide move is applied only to bflinks, so there is no issue
about surgery coefficients.
Given $K$ and $K'$ two distinct components of a
bflink start by making a close parallel copy of $K'$ in such a way that 
it forms an immersed band with its originator $K$.
Let $K''$ be the connected sum of $K$ and the copy of $K'$. 
The connected sum is defined by a em new band which is a
thin rectangle arbitrarily embedded into $\mathbb{S}^3$, so as to miss the link. 
The short sides of this band 
are attached to $K$ and to the copy of $K'$ and then, recoupled in the other way.
The new band can be quite complicated because it may wander
arbitrarily (as long as it misses the link) 
in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in its way to connecting
the two components. More details in Kauffman's book, \cite{kauffman1991knots}. 
In bflink language, this move
is depicted in all its generality, via the hieroglyph shown in the bottom part of the 
Figure. See Section 12.3 of \cite{kauffman1994tlr}. However,
this hieroglyphic move is non-local because the outside of the hieroglyph changes, and 
since there are infinite exteriors, there are infinite Kirby's band moves.

\subsubsection{Fenn-Rourk reformulation of Kirby's calculus}


\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\sf Notation for special disk neighborhoods of general position decorated link projections}
\label{fig:somenotation}
\end{center}
\end{figure} 

In 1979 R. Fenn and C. Rourke (\cite{fenn1979kirby}) show that Kirby's moves could 
be replaced by an infinite sequence of a single type of move (a {\em blow down move})
indexed by $n$, which I depict at the left side of Fig. \ref{fig:FennRourkeAndKauffmanMove}. 
In a blow down move the number of components decreases by 1.
This has been a very useful reformulation with many applications, 
including Martelli's calculus (soon to be treated)
which uses it instead of the direct moves of Kirby. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=11.5cm]{A.figs/FennRourkeAndKauffmanMove.pdf} 
\caption{\sf Fenn-Rourke infinite sequence of blown-down moves 
and their counterpart in Kauffman's blackboard framed links. These are

an isolated $\pm 1$-framed component or the unknot with one crossing by nothing.
Martelli replaced the infinite sequence by the first three and two new simple
moves $A_3$ and $A_4$, described in Fig. \ref{fig:Martelli}.}
\label{fig:FennRourkeAndKauffmanMove}
\end{center}
\end{figure} 

\subsubsection{Kauffman's idea to let the plane induce the integer framing}
In the beginning of the 1990's L. Kauffman
presented (\cite{kauffman1991knots}) a completely planar diagramatic way to deal with the 
calculus of Kirby and its reformulation by Fenn and Rourke.
The basic idea comes from the fact that every 3-manifold is
induced by surgery on a framed link which has {\em only finite integer framings}. 
This characterize the {\em handle surgeries}. According to 
Rolfsen Lickorish call each of these a
{\em honest surgery}, page 262 of \cite{rolfsen2003knots}.
The proof that we can get any manifold by surgery on integer framed links 
uses, as a lemma,  the fact that it is possible to
modify the framed link maintaining the induced 3-manifold so that every component becomes unknotted. 
A proof of this lemma appears in Rolfsen's book. 
It also apears in page 137 of Kauffman-Lins monography,
\cite{kauffman1994tlr}. If a component is unknotted then 
it is simple to modify the link so that each component gets an integer framing, without 
distub the integrality of the framing of other components. So, without loss of
generality we may suppose that all the components have finite integers as framings. Kauffman's proceeds
by adjusting each component by attaching to it a judicious number of curls so that the required framing of
a component coincides with the algebraic sum of its self-crossings. 
By specifying that the link is {\em blackboard framed}, we no longer need the integers to
specifies the framing. They are a consequence.
In this work I only use links given by blackboard framed projections: 
they are rather close of blinks, which are just purely graph theoretical plane graphs with 
an edge bipartition.

\subsubsection{Martelli's finite calculus on fractionary framed link}
In an important recent paper B. Martelli \cite{martelli2012finite} 
presented a local and finite reformulation of
the Fenn-Rourke version (\cite{fenn1979kirby}) of Kirby's calculus \cite{kirby1978calculus}. 
This calculus is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:Martelli}. It remains
to be seen the consequences of Martelli' s result for obtaining new 3-manifold invariants.
A possible door for obtaining such invariants are generalizations of the combinatorial 
approach to get WRT-invariants, justified in \cite{kauffman1994tlr} and extensely
used in \cite{lins1995gca} and in \cite{lins2007blink}. To find such a generalization 
one has to take advantage of the specific sufficient local Martelli's moves now available 
(or the coin calculus on blinks). The WRT-invariants are obtained by  
hiding in the Temperley-Lieb algebra the infinite cases of Kirby's band move, 
as pioneered by Lickorish in \cite{lickorish1991three}. 
See also page 144 of the join monography of L. Kauffman and myself, \cite{kauffman1994tlr}.
Finding such generalization of the WRT-invariants still seems to be a formidable task.
However, Martelli's theorem and the coin calculus on blinks make it conceivable. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=16.5cm]{A.figs/Martelli.pdf} 
\caption{\sf Martelli's calculus on r-bflinks.
Each component of the r-bflink is endowed with an irreducible
fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ assigned to it, $q>p\ge 0$. The surgery 
coeficients $(p',q)$ of the solid torus obtained by $\delta$-thickening the 
corresponding ribbon satisfies: $\frac{p'}{q}=z+\frac{p}{q}$, where $z$ is the 
linking number of the boundary components of the ribbon. Note that for the internal
components of all the above moves the residual surgery coefficient is 0.
Martelli' proves that by keeping only
the blown down of ranks 0, 1 and 2 and replacing all the remaining infinite sequence by two
new moves,  2- and 3-cable engulfing (denoted by $A_3$ and $A_4$), a sufficient 
calculus for factorizing 
homeomorphisms between closed oriented and connected 3-manifolds is achieved solely 
in terms of the above 5 local moves plus the regular isotopies moves and the ribbon move. 
Moves $A_3$ and $A_4$ do not translate into blink moves
because their left sides are disconnected. What makes this work possible is the replacement of
these non-connected configurations by equivalent moves $a_3$ and $a_4$ 
so that blink translations become available. 
The equivalence is proved in Fig. \ref{fig:proofequivalencea3A3a4A4} 
where the diagrams for the moves

\subsection{This work from an epistemological point of view}
\label{sec:objective}
I proceed by further reformulating Martelli's moves so as to obtain a calculus
of blinks, denominated {\em coin calculus}. It is is an exact combinatorial counterpart for factorizing homeomorphisms of
closed, orientable, connected 3-manifolds. It has the consequence that each 3-manifold
becomes a subtle class of plane graphs. This exposition has been and will remain
complete and elementary. It seeks to reach both audiences: 
Topologists and Combinatorialists. We feel that this 
result may be interesting for Combinatorics as well as to Topology and 
may enhance both areas: conceivably, some 
deep properties of plane graphs could be used to elucidate aspects of 
3-manifolds and vice-versa. 

Plane graphs are one of the most 
studied objects in Combinatorics. The role of planarity in finding polynomial efficient algorithm
is well established. For instance, the {\em Max Cut Problem},(\cite{garey1979computers}),
an NP-complete problem, becomes polynomial,
if the graph is in the plane. This was a consequence of J. Edmonds's optimal 
maximum matching theory polyhedral theory: \cite{Edmonds1965, edmonds1973matching}. 
Other NP-complete problems like the {\em Max Stable Vertex Set Problem}(\cite{garey1979computers}),
remain NP-complete when restricted to plane
graphs. Also well established is the
the role of plane graphs motivating and permitting useful generalizations 
in matroid theory, \cite{tutte1965lectures}.
Matroids are a source of polynomial algorithms. A. Lehman used this theory 
to provide a solution for the Shannon Switching Game \cite{lehman1964solution}. 
This solution was enhanced to a polynomial algorithm by J. Edmonds in \cite{edmonds1965lehman}.
Plane graphs and this paper were the motivation for his unexpected and amazing algorithm for polynomially 
finding a matroid partition into indepedent subsets, \cite{edmonds1968matroid}, with its 
various applications to scheduling problems. Yes, I do believe in {\em One Mathematics}, as advocated by 
L. Lovasz, in his famous essay, \cite{lovasz1998om}. The area of combinatorics, particularly
the area of efficient polynomial algorithms based on polyhedral methods had, ten years ago,
its maturity declared by means of the publication of its {\em Magnum Opus}, in three volumes with more than
1800 mathematically dense pages, by A. Schrijver, 
\cite{schrijver2003cop1, schrijver2003cop2, schrijver2003cop3}. It is my hope that
some aspects of the polyhedral theory may have consequences on 3-manifolds algorithmic theory.

Two interesting open questions relating plane graphs and 3-manifolds are: 
(1) Which 3-manifolds correspond to the class of 3-connected monochromatic blinks?
I have reasons to believe that the pair $\{$blink, dual blink$\}$ 
(and the associated $\{$graphic-cographic$\}$ matroids) 
is a complete invariant for these manifolds: a census of
all the 242 blinks which are $3$-connected, monochromatic 
and have up to 16 edges appear in \cite{lins2007blink}. In the domain of the census,
the pair $\{$graphical/cographical$\}$ matroids is a complete invariant.
(2) The theorem established in this work brings closer of being true an old quest of mine: 
is there a way to associate a matroidal invariant to a general closed, orientable and connected
3-manifold?

Eleven years ago, I. Agol, J. Hass and W. Thurston proved that {\em 3-manifold knot genus is NP-complete}, \cite{agol2002}.
There seems to be relatively few results along this line. This one in particular suffer from the fact
that it is very difficult to work combinatorially and to 
visualize a knot in an arbitrary 3-manifold. I think that
discovering more NP-complete problems in 3-manifolds could arise from the result here presented.
After all NP-complete problems abound in plane graphs. In my wildest dreams I see myself 
showing that reformulating one of these plane graph problem into the corresponding 
3-manifold problem is polynomially solvable by topological means.

\section{Proof of the Theorem}
\label{sec:prooftheorem}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{A.figs/proofequivalencea3A3a4A4.pdf} 
\caption{\sf A proof that in the presence of 
$\pm r_{2}^{\pm 1}$, the equivalences   
$a_3 \equiv A_3$ and $a_4 \equiv A_4$ hold}
\label{fig:proofequivalencea3A3a4A4}
\end{center}
\end{figure} 

\begin{lemma}
 In the presence of Reidemeister moves 2, generaly denoted by $\pm r_2^{\pm -1}$,
 moves $\pm a_3$ and $\pm A_3$ are equivalent and so are
 moves $\pm a_4$ and $\pm A_4$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
 We refer to  Fig. \ref{fig:proofequivalencea3A3a4A4}. Its first line proves that $\pm a_3 \Rightarrow \pm A_3$.
 The second line proves that $\pm A_3 \Rightarrow \pm a_3$. The third line proves 
 that $\pm a_4 \Rightarrow \pm A_a$. The last line proves that $\pm A_4 \Rightarrow \pm a_4$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proof} ({\bf of Theorem \ref{theo:theorem}})\\
In Fig. \ref{fig:bflinkandlinktogether} we draw all the moves 
for the revised Martelli's moves on pairs of distinctly 2-colored bflinks 
and the respective blinks superimposed. The result follows by removing the 
bflink moves leaving only the blink moves which are redrawn up to isotopy,
in the lower part of the figure.
\end{proof}

the moves for the coin calculus in the lower part of the figure,

\section{The role of the ribbon moves  $\pm \mu_{11}^{\pm 1}$}
\label{sec:roleribbonmoves}
The counterpart of the ribbon moves in the coin calculus, 
(also called ribbon moves) $\pm\mu_{11}^{\pm 1}$ are redundant 
because Martelli's calculus is in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We include them 
in the coin calculus because with their inclusions all the dual moves,
except $\mu_{20}^\star$ and $\mu_{02}^\star$, become redundant.
\begin{lemma}
Let $f$ be the external infinite face of a decorated general position 
link projection and $g$ be a face adjacent to $f$. Then it is possible 
to interchange $f$ and $g$ by means of regular isotopies and
one finger move.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
 The proof is given in Fig. \ref{fig:changeexternalface}.
\end{proof}



\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=16cm]{A.figs/changeexternalface.pdf}
\caption{\sf Changing the external face $f$ to be any one of its 
adjacent faces $g$ by means of $r_2$, $r_3$ (regular isotopies) 
and the ribbon move: the passage from the first to the 
second configurations is a {\em finger move} where a small segment of an edge is
arbitrarily deformed as a {\em finger} passing over all the crossings of the 
dark gray rectangle; the finger move can be factored by regular isotopies; by other
four finger moves one can go from the second to the third to the fourth 
configuration; the passage from the fourth to the fifth 
configuration is simply an isotopy; from the fifth to the sixth is a ribbon move;
finally, the passage from the sixth to the seventh is acomplished by
Whitney's trick, depicted in the proof below; Whitney's trick also factors as
regular isotopies, as shown in the proof of Corollary \ref{cor:soinsimplification}.
The net effect is to interchange the faces $f$ and $g$: the initial infinite face is $f$ 
and, at the end, the infinite face is $g$.
}
\label{fig:changeexternalface}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{corollary}
\label{cor:soinsimplification}
 The coin calculus can be simplified to include only the following set of 36 moves
 $ \{\pm \mu_{20}, \pm \mu_{02}, \pm \mu_{20}^\star, \pm \mu_{02}^\star, 
 \pm \mu_{33}^{\pm1}, \pm \mu_{01}, \pm \mu_{01},  \pm \mu_{11}^{\pm -1}, \pm \mu_{31},  \pm \mu_{13},  
 \pm \mu_{54},  \pm \mu_{45}, \pm \mu_{66}^{\pm},\pm \mu_{99}^{\pm}\}.$
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
We work in the language of bflinks.
Moves corresponding to $(\pm \mu_{11}^{\pm1})^\star$ and  $(\pm \mu_{33}^{\pm1})^\star$ are redundant 
because $\pm \mu_{11}^{\pm1}$  $\pm \mu_{33}^{\pm1}$ are self dual. 
Moves $\pm\mu_{10}^\star$ and  $\pm\mu_{01}^\star$ are implied by a combination of moves 
$\pm \mu_{10}$,  $\pm \mu_{01}$,  $\pm \mu_{11}$ and $(\pm \mu_{11})^{-1}$. 
In particular, all the Reidemeister 2 and 3 moves (regular isotopy) 
are at our disposal. We can use this fact to change the external face of
the link diagram to become any chosen adjacent face by using regular isotopy at the cost of creating two 
curls adjacent in the same component with distinct sign and the same rotation number. Use the the appropriate ribbon move to
obtain two curls with the distinct signs and distinct rotation number. Now apply Whitney's trick
which cancel these opposite curls by using $r_2^{\pm 1}$ and $r_3^{\pm 1}$ moves
(regular homotopies):
\raisebox{-3mm}{\includegraphics[width=45mm]{A.figs/whitneytrickproof.pdf}}.
The net effect in the correponding 
final blink  is that it is obtained from the initial blink by dualizing 
and interchanging black and gray
edges. Having this double involutions at our disposal it
is straighforward to obtain all the remaining dual moves.
\end{proof}
In Fig. \ref{fig:reducedblinkcalculus} I present the 36 moves of the final reduced coin calculus.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
I finish this work by presenting below a complete (no misses, no duplicates)
census of the $k$-small 3-manifolds, for $k=8$. 
These are the closed, oriented, connected and prime 3-manifolds 
induced by a blink with at most $k$ edges. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=1.15]{A.figs/prime191Blinks-white-vertices.pdf}
\caption{\sf A complete census (no misses, no duplicates) of 8-small prime 3-manifolds. 
They correspond to the first (by lexicography) 191 closed, oriented, connected and prime 3-manifolds. 
These are such 3-manifolds which are induced by blinks up to $k=8$ edges. 
A blink is a finite plane graph with an (arbitrary) edge bipartition. Such 
census are possible by completely combinatorial methods: we generate a subset of 
blinks that misses no 3-manifold by lexicography and the theory in \cite{lins2007blink};
then we compute the homology and the WRT-invariants; at this level $k=8$ 
these two invariants are seen to be complete. An entirely 
combinatorial recipe directly implementable to compute the WRT-invariants of a 3-manifold from 
a blink inducing it is given in Chapter 7 of \cite{lins1995gca}.
This recipe, in its turn is justified by at the very basic level, also by the combinatorial
theory developed in \cite{kauffman1994tlr}. There are 3 independent implementations 
of to obtain the Kauffman-Lins version (depending upon the Temperley-Lieb algebra)
of the WRT-invariants. They were implemented by different people,
in non-overlapping times:
S. Lins (1990-1995), S. Melo (1999-2001) and L. Lins (2006-2007). The results agree.
The software BLINK which compute these invariants and the above census by exhaustive
generation of blinks is currently the object of an open source Github project, 
and is available upon request. The sequence of WRT-invariants of a closed oriented 
connected 3-manifold is an infinite sequence of complex numbers, indexed by $r\ge3$. 
The $r$-th WRT-invariant of a manifold is directly obtained 
from a blink inducing it.
